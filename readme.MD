**DAPHNE** (**D**ATG-**P**INN for **H**eat **N**etwork **E**xtraction) is a Deep Learning framework to identify the temperature field produced by blood vessels. Ths parametric Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)  reconstructs the internal thermal field of a tissue and extracts the location and effect of embedded heat networks (specifically, blood vessels around a tumor) using only sparse surface temperature data from DATG acquisitions.
